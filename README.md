# cafe_menu
This is an introduction to CSS while I'm creating a Cafe Menu project from freeCodeCamp

☕ Cafe Menu
A simple, static webpage developed as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification.

This project focuses on building foundational HTML and basic CSS skills to structure content and apply initial styling. It represents the "Cafe Menu" step of the certification path.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: For structuring the content (menu items, headings, links).

CSS: For basic styling, layout, and presentation.
